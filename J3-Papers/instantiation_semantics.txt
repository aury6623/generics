1. Introduction
===============

The purpose of this paper is to establish the formal specs for the
proposed TEMPLATE feature with regard to semantics of the INSTANTIATE
statement.  Section 2 contains the specs.

2. Formal specs
===============

A. The INSTANTIATE statement defines concrete instances of entities of
   the specified template as external entities.

Concerns:
  - identical instances for identical params

B1. Instantiations of a given TEMPLATE with identical actual template
    parameters define the same concrete instance.

A2. The actual parameter for a procedure template parameter is
    determined by generic resolution and resolves to the actual
    procedure used.

**** I found this sentence confusing as worded ****
    It also is determined by resolving any renames of the procedure
    through use association.

???? is D3 necessary?
A3. The actual parameter for a type template parameter is the actual type
    defined, not simply the name provided at instantiation.

A4. The actual parameter for a constant template parameter is the value of the
    parameter.
