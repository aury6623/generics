1. Introduction
===============


2. Formal specs
===============

A. TEMPLATE is a named construct.

B1. TEMPLATE definition has the following elements:
   - comma separated list of dummy template parameters
   - specification section (possibly empty)
   - optional procedure section begining with a CONTAINS statement

   Suggestive syntax:

   TEMPLATE T(a,b) 
   ! specification section
   CONTAINS
   ! procedure definitions
   END TEMPLATE T

B2. The permitted order of statements in a template is the same as that for
    other program units.

B3. The dummy parameters for a TEMPLATE must be defined prior to any
    references, and must be after any USE, IMPORT, and IMPLICIT NONE
    statements.

C. A TEMPLATE can be defined in the specification section of:
   - main program
   - module
   - another template
   - procedure
   - inner procedure

   Q1: submodule?
   Q2: Can you have a "bare" template?  I think not.
   
D. A TEMPLATE can be referenced by host association or use association

   Q: Does this cover the case of a template instantiated in same
      scope as definition?


E1. There shall be a new, nonexecutable specification construct:
    INSTANTIATE for instantiating templates.

E2. The INSTANTIATE statement can be used in any of:
    - main program
    - module
    - another template
    - procedure
    - inner procedure
