1. Introduction
===============

The purpose of this paper is to establish the formal specs for
the RESTRICTION construct and REQUIRES statement.

2 . Formal specs
================

A1. A RESTRICTION is a named construct for encapsulating a
   set of interfaces involving deferred types.

A2. A RESTRICTION has a list of named dummy parameters that have same
    specifications as those of template dummy parameters.


B1. A REQUIRES statement specifies the name of a RESTRICTION and
    provides actual parameters corresponding to its dummy parameters.

B2. A REQUIRES statement is confirmed if the actual parameters conform
    to the corresponding dummy parameters of the reference RESTRICTION.

C1. If a template dummy parameter appears in a REQUIRES statement it
    does not need to be separately declared in the template
    specification section.
