Subject: Formal syntax (1 of 3): deferred arguments
Date: 2024-May-06

Reference:

This paper is the first of three that comprise the formal syntax for
generic programming features in Fortran, aka templates.

1. Introduction
===============

This paper defines the formal syntax for deferred arguments.  Paper 2
covers the syntax related to the TEMPLATE construct and INSTANTIATION
statement, while paper 3 provides the syntax for the REQUIREMENT
construct and the REQUIRES statement.

Deferred arguments are template "dummy" arguments that are given their
"values" when the template is instantiated.  Deferred arguments can be
constants, procedures, or types.

Section 2 provides a non-pedagogical example that exercises most of the
proposed syntax.  Section 3 defines the formal syntax for deferred
entities.

2. Example
==========

MODULE A

   REQUIREMENT R{U,G}
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: U
      INTERFACE
         FUNCTION G(x, i) RESULT(y)
            TYPE(U) :: y
            TYPE(U), INTENT(IN) :: x
            INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: i
         END FUNCTION G
      END INTERFACE
   END REQUIREMENT R

   TEMPLATE B{T,F,C}
      REQUIRES R{T,F}            ! provides interface for deferred F
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: T        ! redundant decl of deferred type T
      INTEGER, CONSTANT :: C(..) ! deferred rank constant
   CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE SUB1(x)
         TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: x
         x = F(x, SUM(C))
      END SUBROUTINE SUB1
      SUBROUTINE SUB2(x)
         TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: x
         x = F(x, MAXVAL(C))
      END SUBROUTINE SUB2
   END TEMPLATE B

CONTAINS

   SUBROUTINE SUB3{V,D}(x)
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: V
      INTEGER, CONSTANT :: D
      TYPE(V), INTENT(INOUT) :: x(D)
      x(D) = x(1)
   END SUBROUTINE

END MODULE A

MODULE C
  USE MODULE A

  INSTANTIATE B{REAL, OPERATOR(*), [3,4]}, ONLY: &
              & tot_sub1 => sub1
  INSTANTIATE B{REAL, OPERATOR(+), [3,4]}, ONLY: & ! different instance
              & max_sub2 => sub2

CONTAINS

   SUBROUTINE DO_SOMETHING(x)
      REAL, INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      INTEGER :: y(3)

      x = 2.
      CALL tot_sub1(x)
      PRINT*,'TOT: ', x ! expect 2. * (3+4) = 14.

      x = 3.
      CALL max_sub2(x)
      PRINT*,'MAX: ', x ! expect 3. + max(3,4) = 7.

      y(1) = 4
      call sub3{INTEGER, 3}(y)
      PRINT*, y(3) ! expect 4
   END SUBROUTINE DO_SOMETHING

END MODULE C


3. Syntax for Deferred entities
===============================

A deferred argument is an entity that takes some of its
characteristics from its ultimate instantiation argument.  A deferred
argument can be a constant, type, or procedure and can appear in a
REQUIREMENT construct, TEMPLATE construct, or simple template
procedure (STP).  Association with instantiation arguments occurs in the
REQUIRES and INSTANTIATE statements.

A deferred constant is a deferred argument that can appear in constant
expressions within a REQUIREMENT construct, TEMPLATE construct, or STP.

A deferred type is a deferred argument that can appear as a
<type-spec> within a REQUIREMENT construct, TEMPLATE construct, or
STP.

A deferred procedure is a deferred argument that can appear in
procedure references within a REQUIREMENT construct, TEMPLATE
construct, or STP.  A deferred procedure's interface shall be
established in that construct, possibly in terms of other deferred
arguments.

Within a construct with a <deferred-arg>, an explicit specification of
that <deferred-arg> is either <deferred-arg-explicit-stmt> or
<interface-body>.

A <deferred-arg> shall have one or more ultimate specifications.  The
ultimate specifications of a <deferred-arg> are:
    - an explicit specification, if present, and
    - its ultimate specifications as instantiation arguments in
      REQUIRES statements, if any.
The ultimate specifications of an instantiation argument in a REQUIRES
statement are the ultimate specifications of the corresponding
deferred argument in the referenced requirement construct.

Note: The approach here is that a deferred argument is always
      eventually explicitly declared at some level of nesting of
      requirements.  A deferred argument must have at least one
      ultimate specification and may have multiple.

Note: If a deferred argument has multiple ultimate specifications,
      they must be consistent.  Constraints on consistency are
      defined in section 3.2.

Some examples of declarations of deferred arguments are shown below.

   INTEGER, CONSTANT :: C(..) ! Sec. 3.1.1
   TYPE, DEFERRED :: T ! Sec. 3.1.3
   INTERFACE ! Sec. 3.1.2
      FUNCTION F(X)
         TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: X
         TYPE(T) :: F
      END FUNCTION
      SUBROUTINE S(Y)
         TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: Y
      END SUBROUTINE
   END INTERFACE
   PROCEDURE(F_I) :: G  ! Sec. 3.1.2

3.1 Syntax for deferred arguments
---------------------------------

A deferred argument declaration statement is used to declare
deferred arguments.

<deferred-arg> <<is>> <deferred-const>
               <<or>> <deferred-proc>
               <<or>> <deferred-type>
               <<or>> <deferred-class>

Constraint: A <deferred-arg> shall have at most one explicit
            specification in a given scoping unit.

Constraint: A <deferred-arg> declaration shall not have an
            <access-spec> nor shall it appear in an <access-stmt>.

Note: Deferred arguments are local identifiers and are not externally
      accessible.

<deferred-arg-decl-stmt> <<is>> <deferred-arg-explicit-stmt>
                         <<or>> <requires-stmt>

<deferred-arg-explicit-stmt> <<is>> <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>
                             <<or>> <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt>
                             <<or>> <deferred-type-declaration-stmt>

3.1.1 Syntax for deferred constants

<deferred-const-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
           <declaration-type-spec>, <deferred-const-attr-spec> ::
           <deferred-const-entity-decl-list>

<deferred-const-attr-spec> <<is>> [<deferred-attr-spec>,]...
                                      CONSTANT
                                      [,<deferred-attr-spec>]...

<deferred-attr-spec> <<is>> <dimension-spec>
                     <<or>> <rank-clause>

Constraint: An entity declared in <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>
            shall be INTEGER, LOGICAL, or assumed-length CHARACTER.

Note: For now, we explicitly disallow fixed-length character deferred
      arguments.  Partly this is to not prejudice further work on
      deferred arguments with length type parameters.

<deferred-const-entity-decl> <<is>> <deferred-const> [ ( <array-spec> ) ]

Constraint: If <array-spec> appears in
            <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>, it shall be
            <implied-shape-spec>, <assumed-or-deferred-rank-spec>,
            <explicit-shape-spec-list>, or
            <explicit-shape-bounds-spec>.

Constraint: If <implied-shape-spec>, <explicit-shape-spec> or
            <explicit-shape-bounds-spec> appears in
            <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>, then <lower-bound>
            shall not be specified.

Constraint: If <explicit-shape-bounds-spec> appears in
            <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>, then
            <explicit-bounds-expr> shall not appear as a lower bound.

Note: This prevents non-default lower bounds, and leaves open an avenue
      for backwards compatible extensions for non-default lower bounds
      in the future. 

<deferred-const> <<is>> <name>

Constraint: Each <deferred-const> shall appear in <deferred-arg-list>
            of the innermost scoping unit.

A <deferred-const> is a deferred constant.

Some examples of declaring deferred constants are as follows.

    ! explicit shape
    integer, constant  :: x1
    integer, constant  :: x2(3)
    integer, parameter :: v1(2) = [5,15] ! not a deferred constant
    integer, constant  :: x3(v1)

    ! implied shape
    integer, constant :: x4(*)
    integer, constant :: x5(*,*)
    integer, constant, rank(2) :: x6

    ! assumed-or-deferred-rank-spec
    integer, constant :: x7(..)

3.1.2 Syntax for deferred procedures

<deferred-proc-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
     PROCEDURE(<interface>) [ :: ] <deferred-proc-list>

<deferred-proc> <<is>> <name>

Constraint: Each <deferred-proc> that appears in a
            <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt> shall appear in
            <deferred-arg-list> of the innermost scoping unit.

Constraint: Each <deferred-proc> shall appear in a
            <deferred-arg-decl-stmt> or as a <function-name> or
            <subroutine-name> within an <interface-body>.

A <deferred-proc> is a deferred procedure.  A <deferred-arg> that
appears as the <function-name> or <subroutine-name> in an
<interface-body> is a deferred procedure.

3.1.3 Syntax for deferred types

# Intrinsic types
    - type, deferred :: T
      - type(T) :: local
    X - class(T) :: local
  X - class, deferred :: T
    X - type(T) :: local
    X - class(T) :: local
    
# Non-extensible derived types
    - type, deferred :: T
      - type(T) :: local
    X - class(T) :: local
  X  - class, deferred :: T
    X - type(T) :: local
    X - class(T) :: local

# Extensible derived types
    - type, deferred :: T
      - type(T) :: local
    X - class(T) :: local
    - class, deferred :: T
    X - type(T) :: local
      - class(T) :: local

# Abstract extensible derived types
  X - type, deferred :: T
    X - type(T) :: local
    X - class(T) :: local
    - class, deferred :: T
    X - type(T) :: local
      - class(T) :: local


<deferred-type-declaration-stmt>
       <<is>>  TYPE, DEFERRED :: <deferred-type-list>
       <<or>>  CLASS, DEFERRED :: <deferred-class-list>

<deferred-type> <<is>> <name>

<deferred-class> <<is>> <name>

Constraint: A <deferred-type> or <deferred-class> entity shall not
            appear as <parent-type-name> in an EXTENDS attribute.

Constraint: Each <deferred-type> shall appear in
            <deferred-arg-list> of the innermost scoping unit.

Constraint: Each <deferred-class> shall appear in
            <deferred-arg-list> of the innermost scoping unit.

A <deferred-type> is a deferred type. A <deferred-class> is an
abstract derived type.

Note: <deferred-type> will not be allowed in a CLASS declaration, and
      a <deferred-class> will not be allowed in a TYPE declaration.
      These are implied by extensions planned for section 7.3.2.1 Type
      specifier syntax.

      Simple example illustrating the above.

      TEMPLATE TMPL(T, U)
         TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
         CLASS, DEFERRED :: U
      CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE S(X, Y, Z, W)
            TYPE(T) :: X ! ok
            CLASS(T) :: Y ! invalid
            TYPE(U) :: Z ! invalid
            CLASS(U) :: W ! ok
         END SUBROUTINE S
      END TEMPLATE TMPL


3.2 Specification of deferred arguments
---------------------------------------

The specification of a deferred argument is explicit if it appears in
the outermost scope in which it is a deferred argument.

3.2.1 Specification of deferred constants

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred argument is a
            deferred constant, then all ultimate specifications of
            that deferred argument shall be deferred constant.

Constraint: All ultimate specifications of a deferred constant shall
            specify the same type and kind-type parameters.

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred constant is of
            a non-deferred rank R, then an explicit specification of
            that deferred constant shall have rank R, and all other
            ultimate specifications of that deferred constant shall
            either have deferred rank or have rank R.

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred constant has
            explicit shape S, then an explicit specification of that
            deferred constant shall have shape S, and all other
            ultimate specifications of that deferred constant shall
            have deferred rank, implied shape, or shape S.

If any ultimate specification of a deferred constant has an explicit
shape S, then that deferred constant has shape S.  Otherwise, if any
ultimate specification of that deferred constant has implied shape,
then it has implied shape with the same rank.  Otherwise it has
deferred rank.

3.2.2 Specification of deferred procedures

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred argument is a
            deferred procedure, then all ultimate specifications of
            that deferred argument shall be deferred procedure.

Constraint: A deferred procedure shall only be referenced with keyword
            arguments if it has an explicit specification.

Constraint: Except for PURE, SIMPLE, and ELEMENTAL attributes, the
            characteristics of all ultimate specifications of a
            deferred procedure shall be consistent.

Note: The characteristics of a procedure do not include the names
      of the dummy arguments, so they need not be the same.

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred procedure is
            SIMPLE, then an explicit specification of that deferred
            procedure shall be SIMPLE.

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred procedure is
            PURE, then an explicit specification of that deferred
            procedure shall be PURE or SIMPLE.

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred procedure is
            ELEMENTAL, then an explicit specification of that deferred
            procedure shall be ELEMENTAL.

If any ultimate specification of a deferred procedure is SIMPLE then
that deferred procedure is SIMPLE. Otherwise, if any ultimate
specification of that deferred procedure is PURE, then it is PURE.

If any ultimate specification of a deferred procedure is ELEMENTAL then
that deferred procedure is ELEMENTAL.

Only an explicit specification of a <deferred-proc> defines the names
of its dummy arguments.

Note: Unless a <deferred-proc> has an explicit specification, the
      names of its dummy arguments are processor-dependent.  The
      intent is that users be unable to access the arguments via
      keywords.


3.2.3 Specification of deferred types

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred argument is a
            deferred type, then all ultimate specifications of that
            deferred argument shall be deferred type.

Constraint: If any ultimate specification of a deferred argument is a
            deferred class, then all ultimate specifications of that
            deferred argument shall be deferred class.

If any ultimate specification is deferred type, then that argument is
deferred type.

If any ultimate specification is deferred class, then that argument is
deferred class.

3.3 Deferred argument association
---------------------------------

This will be discussed in a subsequent paper.
