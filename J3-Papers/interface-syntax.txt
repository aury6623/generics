Introduction:
=============

<interface-stmt> <<is>> [NEWFANGLED] INTERFACE [generic-spec]
                 <<or>> [NEWFANGLED] ABSTRACT INTERFACE

Constraint: If NEWFANGLED does not appear, then there is no host
            association and the default implicit mapping is in effect
            in the interface bodies.

Note: If NEWFANGLED is present, then <interface-body> has host
      association and inherits the implicit mapping from the surrounding
      scope.   Likewise, <procedure-stmt> does not need MODULE.

Straw vote: How should NEWFANGLED be spelled?
            - EXPLICIT
            - HOSTED
            - DIRECT
            - EXACT
            - INCLUSIVE
            - CONFUSING
