<interface-stmt> <<is>> [NEWFANGLED] INTERFACE [generic-spec]
                 <<or>> [NEWFANGLED] ABSTRACT INTERFACE

Constraint: If NEWFANGLED does not appear, then there is no host
            association and the default implicit mapping is in effect
            in the interface bodies.

            - EXPLICIT
            - HOSTED
            - DIRECT
            - EXACT
