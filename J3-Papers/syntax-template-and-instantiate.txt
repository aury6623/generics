Reference: 

1. Introduction
===============

This paper defines the syntax for the TEMPLATE construct, the
INSTANTIATE statement, simple template procedures, and inline
instantiation.

An example template is shown below.

   TEMPLATE TMPL(T, F)
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
      INTERFACE
         FUNCTION F(X)
            TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: X
            TYPE(T) :: F
         END FUNCTION
      END INTERFACE
   CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE S(Y)
         TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: Y
         Y = F(Y)
      END SUBROUTINE
   END TEMPLATE

An example simple template procedure, equivalent to the above
template is shown below.

   SUBROUTINE S{T, F}(Y)
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
      INTERFACE
         FUNCTION F(X)
            TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: X
            TYPE(T) :: F
         END FUNCTION
      END INTERFACE
      TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: Y
      Y = F(Y)
   END SUBROUTINE

Example instantiate statements of TMPL are:

   INSTANTIATE TMPL(integer, operator(-)), only: negate => S
   INSTANTIATE TMPL(real, sin)

An example of an inline instantiation of the simple template
procedure would be as follows.

   CALL S{integer, operator(-)}(i)
   CALL S{real, sin}(x)

2. Syntax for templates
=======================

2.1 Syntax for the TEMPLATE construct
-------------------------------------

A template is a set of declarations, specifications and definitions
that are enabled by instantiation.  A TEMPLATE construct defines a
template.  A template is a scoping unit to which use and host
association and template argument association can be applied.  A
template can be defined in the specification section of a program unit
other than a block data program unit.

<template> <<is>> <template-stmt>
                      [ <template-specification-part> ]
                      [ <template-subprogram-part> ]
                      <end-template-stmt>

<template-stmt> <<is>> TEMPLATE <template-name> {[<deferred-arg-list>]}

<end-template-stmt> <<is>>  END [TEMPLATE [<template-name>]]

Constraint: If a <template-name> appears in the <end-template-stmt>,
            it shall be identical to the <template-name>
            specified in the <template-stmt>.

2.1.1 Template specification part
---------------------------------

<template-specification-part> <<is>>
            [ use-stmt ] ...
            [ <template-declaration-construct> ] ...

The implicit mapping within <template> is as if
       IMPLICIT NONE(TYPE,EXTERNAL)
is in place.

<template-declaration-construct> <<is>> <template-specification-construct>
                                 <<or>> <deferred-arg-decl-stmt>
                                 <<or>> <requirement>
                                 <<or>> <template>
                                 <<or>> <interface-block>

<template-specification-construct>
                      <<is>> <access-stmt>
                      <<or>> <derived-type-def>
                      <<or>> <dimension-stmt>
                      <<or>> <enum-def>
                      <<or>> <enumeration-type-def>
                      <<or>> <generic-stmt>
                      <<or>> <instantiate-stmt>
                      <<or>> <intrinsic-stmt>
                      <<or>> <parameter-stmt>
                      <<or>> <type-declaration-stmt>

Note: The analogous construct for MODULE is divided into two separate
      constructs: <specific-construct> and
      <other-specification-construct>.  However, subgroup does not see
      the criteria by which items were assigned to either construct.
      Further since TEMPLATE admits fewer items, we have decided to
      merge these two constructs.

Note: A DATA, FORMAT, ENTRY or statement function statement shall not
      appear in the template specification part.

Note: An ALLOCATABLE, ASYNCHRONOUS, BIND, CODIMENSION, CONTIGUOUS,
      EXTERNAL, INTENT, NAMELIST, OPTIONAL, POINTER, PROTECTED, SAVE,
      TARGET, VOLATILE, VALUE, COMMON, or EQUIVALENCE statement shall
      not appear in the template specification part.

Constraint: An entity declared by <type-declaration-stmt> shall have
            the PARAMETER attribute.

Note: This is to say, the template specification section cannot
      declare variables.


2.1.2 Template subprogram part
------------------------------

<template-subprogram-part> <<is>> <contains-stmt>
                                     [ <template-subprogram> ] ...

<template-subprogram> <<is>> <function-subprogram>
                      <<or>> <subroutine-subprogram>


2.2 Simple template procedures
------------------------------

A simple template procedure is a template whose only public entity is
a procedure.  This allows brevity in declaring and instantiation as
compared to more general templates as described above.


<simple-template-function-subprogram> <<is>>
       <simple-template-function-stmt>
         <simple-template-subprogram-specification-part>
         [<execution-part>]
         [<internal-subprogram-part>]
         <end-function-stmt>

<simple-template-subroutine-subprogram> <<is>>
       <simple-template-subroutine-stmt>
         <simple-template-subprogram-specification-part>
         [<execution-part>]
         [<internal-subprogram-part>]
         <end-subroutine-stmt>

<simple-template-subprogram-specification-part> <<is>>
     [ <use-stmt> ] ...
     [ <import-stmt> ] ...
     [ <simple-template-subprogram-declaration-construct> ] ...

<simple-template-subprogram-declaration-construct> <<is>>
     <specification-construct>
     <<or>> <template-specification-construct>
     <<or>> <format-stmt>

<simple-template-function-stmt> <<is>>
     [ <prefix> ] FUNCTION <template-name>
         { <deferred-arg-list> } ([<dummy-name-arg-list>])
	 [<suffix>]

<simple-template-subroutine-stmt> <<is>>
     [ <prefix> ] SUBROUTINE <template-name>
         { <deferred-arg-list> } ([<dummy-name-arg-list>])
	 [<proc-language-binding-spec>]

Constraint: If a <function-name> appears in the <end-function-stmt>,
            it shall be identical to the <template-name>
            specified in the <simple-template-function-stmt>.

Constraint: If a <subroutine-name> appears in the <end-subroutine-stmt>,
            it shall be identical to the <template-name>
            specified in the <simple-template-subroutine-stmt>.

2.3 Additional constraints
--------------------------

Constraint: A variable or procedure pointer declared in either a
	    <template-subprogram-part> or a
	    <simple-template-subprogram-declaration-construct> shall
	    not have the SAVE attribute.

Note: If variables were permitted to have the SAVE attribute then
      instantiations of the template with the same instantiation
      arguments could unintentionally modify each other's values.

Constraint: EQUIVALENCE and COMMON shall not appear in a
            <template-subprogram-part> or a
            <simple-template-subprogram-declaration-construct>.


Note: Allowing COMMON statements within a template is a concern even
      when they lack the SAVE attribute.  Namely, if any elements of a
      common block are of deferred type then the memory footprint of a
      common cannot be determined at compilation.

Note: Allowing EQUIVALENCE statements inside a template seems to be ok,
      but subgroup is concerned that there may be corner cases that we are
      not realizing, and would prefer to disallow.

Constraint: <template>, <simple-template-function-subprogram> and
       <simple-template-subroutine-subprogram> shall only reference
       intrinsic procedures, procedures with explicit interfaces, and
       operators.

Note: This constraint expresses the notion of type-safety.  In
      particular, this allows a template implementation to be verified
      to be internally consistent.


3. Syntax for instantiation
===========================

3.1 Syntax for the INSTANTIATE statement
----------------------------------------

The INSTANTIATE statement specifies an instance of a template and
instantiation arguments that become associated with the deferred
arguments of that template.

The INSTANTIATE statement without the ONLY option provides access to
all public entities of the instantiated template.  The INSTANTIATE
statement with the ONLY option provides access only to those entities
that appear as <generic-specs>, <use-names>, or
<use-defined-operators> in the only list.  If <template-name> is the
name of a simplified template procedure, then the only public entity
of the instantiation has the name <template-name>.

An accessible entity of the referenced instantiation is associated
with one or more accessed entities, each with its own identifier.
These identifiers are

   - the identifier of the entity in the referenced template if that
     identifier appears as an <only-use-name> or as the
     <defined-operator> of a <generic-spec> in any <only> for that
     instantiation,
   - each of the <local-names> or <local-defined-operators> that the
     entity is given in any <rename> for that instantiation, and
   - the identifier of the entity in that referenced template if
     that identifier does not appear as a <use-name> or
     <use-defined-operator> in any <rename> for that instantiation.

<instantiate-stmt>
     <<is>> INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> {
            [ <instantiation-arg-spec-list> ] } [, <rename-list> ]
     <<or>> INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> {
            [ <instantiation-arg-spec-list> ] }, ONLY : [ <only-list> ]

Constraint: Within an <instantiate-stmt>, <instantiation-arg> shall
            not depend on any entity defined within the referenced
            template.

Note: <generic-spec> includes operators, defined assignment and
      defined I/O.  The last may be somewhat awkward to use within a
      template without re-expressing as defined I/O again.

3.2 Syntax for inline instantiation of simple template procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A simple template procedure can be instantiated and referenced in
an expression or the <procedure-designator> in a <call-stmt>.

<inline-instantiate> <<is>>
    <template-name> { <instantiation-arg-spec-list> }

Constraint: <template-name> shall be the name of a
            <simple-template-function-subprogram> or a
            <simple-template-subroutine-subprogram>

The procedure designated by <inline-instantiate> is the procedure
produced from instantiating the simplified template procedure.

3.3 Deferred argument association
---------------------------------

Instantiation arguments are specified by an INSTANTIATE statement, a
REQUIRES statement, or by inline instantiation.

<instantiation-arg-spec> <<is>>
        [ <keyword> = ] <instantiation-arg>

Constraint: Each <keyword> shall be the name of a <deferred-arg> in
            the referenced requirement or template.

In the absence of an argument keyword, an instantiation argument
corresponds to the deferred argument occupying the corresponding
position in <deferred-arg-list>; that is, the first instantiation
argument corresponds to the first deferred argument in the
reduced list, the second instantiation argument corresponds to the
second deferred argument in the reduced list, etc.

<instantiation-arg> <<is>> <constant-expr>
                    <<or>> <type-spec>
                    <<or>> <generic-spec>
                    <<or>> <procedure-name>


3.3.1 Deferred constant association

Constraint: <constant-expr> shall be type INTEGER, LOGICAL or
            CHARACTER.

Constraint: An <instantiation-arg> that is a <constant-expr> shall
            correspond to a <deferred-arg> that is a <deferred-const>
            in the referenced template or requirement.

Constraint: The type and kind of an <instantiation-arg> that is a
            <constant-expr> shall have the same type and kind as the
            corresponding <deferred-const> in the referenced template
            or requirement.

Constraint: If the shape of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
            referenced template or requirement is not implied, then
            <constant-expr> shall have the same shape.

Constraint: If the rank of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
            referenced template or requirement is not deferred, then
            <constant-expr> shall have the same rank.


3.3.2 Deferred procedure association

Constraint: An <instantiation-arg> that is a <generic-spec> or
            <procedure-name> shall correspond to a <deferred-arg> that
            is a <deferred-proc> in the referenced template or
            requirement.

Constraint: An <instantiation-arg> that is a <procedure-name> shall
            have the same characteristics as the corresponding
            <deferred-proc> in the referenced template or requirement,
            except that a pure instantiation argument may be
            associated with a deferred argument that is not pure, a
            simple instantiation argument may be associated with a
            deferred argument that is not simple, and an elemental
            instantiation argument may be associated with a deferred
            procedure that is not elemental.

Constraint: An <instantiation-arg> that is a <generic-spec> shall have
            one specific procedure that has the same characteristics
            as the corresponding <deferred-proc> in the referenced
            template or requirement, except that a pure instantiation
            argument may be associated with a deferred argument that
            is not pure, a simple instantiation argument may be
            associated with a deferred argument that is not simple,
            and an elemental instantiation argument may be associated
            with a deferred procedure that is not elemental.

The <deferred-proc> is associated with the specific procedure that is
consistent with the characteristics.

Note: The previous two constraints constitute what is referred to as
      "weak constraints" in other languages.


3.3.3 Deferred type association

Constraint: An <instantiation-arg> that is a <type-spec> shall
            correspond to a <deferred-arg> that is a <deferred-type>
            or <deferred-class> in the referenced template or
            requirement.

Constraint: An <instantiation-arg> that is a <type-spec> shall not be
            abstract.

Constraint: If an <instantiation-arg> is associated with a
            <deferred-type>, a variable of that type shall be
            permitted in a variable definition context.

Constraint: If an <instantiation-arg> is a <type-spec>, it shall not
            specify a type that has a coarray potential subobject
            component.

Constraint: If an <instantiation-arg> corresponds to <deferred-class>,
            it shall be extensible.
