This project is to refine concepts for potential features in Fortran 202Y
that supports generic programming.  (202Y is the internal name for the revision
_after_ the next revision, and is intentionally vague.)

For now, contributions should largely be in the form of motivating use cases
and illustrative examples that highlight issues and approaches.
