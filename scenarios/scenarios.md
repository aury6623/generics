# Catalog of scenarios

This file serves as a catalog of scenarios of motivating use cases and
demonstrations/examples of how generics might work in Fortran.  Each
scenario is given its own subdirectory, and a short description here
in the catalag.  More detailed descriptions and analysis are to be
placed in the relevant scenario subdirectory.

*This document numbers the scenarios so that they can later be used for
traceability in a requirements document for generics.  To preserve
numbering, scenarious should never be removed from this list.   Instead,
mark undesire/obsolete/irrelevant items with strikethrough.*


1. Generic Swap
2. Generic Reduce
3. Cayley-Dickson
4. Block Matrices
5. Generic Containers
6. Generic Error Return
